I'm still fleshing this out, sorry!

scratch pad:
- intro
- enable websocket in streamerbot
- add overlay to OBS
- edit config.js to add events and default settings

- supports audio!
- supports built-in tts!
- supports images!
  
- elaborate on how to create event types
-- note currently supported events
-- explain token replacement

Future ideas:
- support other platforms (please contribute!)
- config builder tool (no-code solution)
- separate project for handling chat(s)
